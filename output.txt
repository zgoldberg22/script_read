Act 1

Scene 1

THE OPENING

#1— Magic To Do

At rise, the stage is filled with smoke and in total darkness except for moving hands.
The hands are illuminated by a light curtain consisting of ungelled flashlights focused
directly upwards mounted on the stage floor which keeps the stage in virtual darkness,
so that the writhing hands exist in a strange macabre limbo.

An orchestral vamp is accompanied by a low, crooning vocal wail.

Then, from the center of the rotating hands, the face of the LEADING PLAYER appears
and is hit by a spotlight. HE crosses the light curtain and moves downstage to the
audience and. sings.

As the song progresses, we can see a bare stage populated by a GROUP of ACTORS.
Their costumes are of an undetermined period. But THEY are definitely PLAYERS ...
a troupe... a theatrical caravan of some kind. )

One by one, THEY come through the light curtain, and are hit by spotlights; until
finally, THEY all come forward and join in the song.

(LEADING PLAYER)
Our tale today concerns the firstborn son of Charlemagne...and is entitled...
(The PLAYERS pull out a large cloth, which has been concealed in one of their
costumes. It reads: PIPPIN: HIS LIFE AND TIMES)

PLAYERS
Pippin!...
OTHER PLAYERS

..His Life and Times!

LEADING PLAYER

But, before we begin, let me assure you that what you are about to see is the true life
story of Pippin. You see there have been many misconceptions about Pippin...one
that he was...

A PLAYER
A hunchback...

LEADING PLAYER
Or-that he was...

A PLAYER

Enormously tall...

LEADING PLAYER
Or that he was...

A PLAYER
Left-handed, except for bowling...

LEADING PLAYER

But I beg you, cast all previous misconceptions aside, and accept what we enact for
you today.

(Pause)
The life of Pippin begins...

(There is a slap and a cry. AWOMAN PLAYER is raised above the sign with a bundle
in her arms)

Pippin, as a child, showed tremendous thirst for knowledge...

(The WOMAN PLAYER is lowered, and the SMALLEST MALE PLAYER is held up
reading a small book)

Immersed in these pursuits, the years went by quickly.

(The PLAYER is lowered and PIPPIN is raised above the sign. HE is reading a large
book. HE looks out at the audience and smiles as HE is lowered behind the sign)
