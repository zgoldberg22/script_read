Act 1
Scene 1
[SONG]: THE OPENING
#1— Magic To Do
At rise, the stage is filled with smoke and in total darkness except for moving hands.
The hands are illuminated by a light curtain consisting of ungelled flashlights focused
directly upwards mounted on the stage floor which keeps the stage in virtual darkness,
so that the writhing hands exist in a strange macabre limbo.
An orchestral vamp is accompanied by a low, crooning vocal wail.
Then, from the center of the rotating hands, the face of the LEADING PLAYER appears
and is hit by a spotlight. HE crosses the light curtain and moves downstage to the
audience and. sings.
As the song progresses, we can see a bare stage populated by a GROUP of ACTORS.
Their costumes are of an undetermined period. But THEY are definitely PLAYERS ...
a troupe... a theatrical caravan of some kind. )
One by one, THEY come through the light curtain, and are hit by spotlights; until
finally, THEY all come forward and join in the song.
