Act 1 Scene 1

THE OPENINGAt rise, the stage is filled with smoke and in total darkness except for moving hands. The hands are illuminated by a light curtain consisting of ungelled flashlights focused directly upwards mounted on the stage floor which keeps the stage in virtual darkness, so that the writhing hands exist in a strange macabre limbo. An orchestral vamp is accompanied by a low, crooning vocal wail. Then, from the center of the rotating hands, the face of the LEADING PLAYER appears and is hit by a spotlight. HE crosses the light curtain and moves downstage to the audience and. sings. As the song progresses, we can see a bare stage populated by a GROUP of ACTORS. Their costumes are of an undetermined period. But THEY are definitely PLAYERS ... a troupe... a theatrical caravan of some kind. ) One by one, THEY come through the light curtain, and are hit by spotlights; until finally, THEY all come forward and join in the song.

[PLAYERS]: Pippin!...

[OTHER PLAYERS]: ..His Life and Times!

[LEADING PLAYER]: But, before we begin, let me assure you that what you are about to see is the true life story of Pippin. You see there have been many misconceptions about Pippin...one that he was...

[A PLAYER]: A hunchback...

[LEADING PLAYER]: Or-that he was...

[A PLAYER]: Enormously tall...

[LEADING PLAYER]: Or that he was...

[A PLAYER]: Left-handed, except for bowling...

[LEADING PLAYER]: But I beg you, cast all previous misconceptions aside, and accept what we enact for you today.  The life of Pippin begins...  Pippin, as a child, showed tremendous thirst for knowledge...  Immersed in these pursuits, the years went by quickly.

[PIPPIN]:  1 suppose it’s a little late to wonder who this man was.

[HEAD]: It is a little late...but as long as you're interested. I’m just a common man, a Visigoth, but a good man...a very good man.

[PIPPIN]: You're also a very lucky man. You’ve had the privilege of dying for your king.

[HEAD]: Words fail me.

[PIPPIN]: You know of course, dying in battle like this, you'll be going straight to Valhalla...or wherever you Infidels go, won’t you?

[HEAD]: Absolutely. The King has assured us personally. But this waiting around’s got me edgy.

[PIPPIN]: This wasn’t your first battle, was it?

[HEAD]: No. My third.

[PIPPIN]: Well then maybe you could tell me, how did this battle compare with your other two?

[HEAD]: Well, unless you get killed, one battle’s pretty much like another.
